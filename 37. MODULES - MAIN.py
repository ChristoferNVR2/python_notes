# module = a file containing Python code. May contain functions, classes, etc.
# used with modular programming, which is to separate a program into parts.

import messages as msg
# we can also use import messages and then use messages.hello() and messages.bye()
# adding 'as msg' is just to make it shorter

msg.hello()
msg.bye()
